# .NET MAUI Local Marketplace Application Development Plan

## Project Overview

We'll create a cross-platform mobile application using .NET MAUI to facilitate buying and selling items locally with map-based discovery features.

## Development Approach - Test-Driven Development (TDD)

We will implement the LocalMarketplace using Test-Driven Development principles:

1. **Write Tests First**: For each feature, write failing tests before writing any implementation code
   - Define expected behavior through test cases
   - Tests should be small, focused, and verify a single aspect of functionality

2. **Implement Minimal Code**: Write just enough code to make tests pass
   - Focus on the simplest solution that satisfies requirements
   - Avoid over-engineering or implementing features not covered by tests

3. **Refactor**: Once tests pass, refactor code to improve design while ensuring tests still pass
   - Clean up code structure and improve readability
   - Eliminate duplication and technical debt

4. **TDD Workflow**:
   - Red: Write a failing test
   - Green: Implement minimal code to pass the test
   - Refactor: Improve the implementation without changing behavior

5. **Testing Cadence**:
   - Write tests at the start of each development task
   - Run the test suite before pushing code to repository
   - Address failing tests immediately
