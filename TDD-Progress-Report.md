# TDD Implementation Progress Report

## Overview

This document outlines the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach we're following for the LocalMarketplace application. We're adhering strictly to the "Red, Green, Refactor" workflow to ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

## TDD Progress Summary

### Completed
1. ‚úÖ Created test models (TestItem, TestUser, TestMessage)
2. ‚úÖ Implemented model tests to verify property change notifications
3. ‚úÖ Created database service interface and tests with mocking
4. ‚úÖ Implemented ViewModel tests following MVVM pattern

### In Progress
1. üîÑ Implementing core ViewModels (ItemViewModel, UserViewModel, LocationViewModel)
2. üîÑ Developing unit tests for additional business logic

### Next Steps
1. ‚è±Ô∏è Create View tests for UI validation
2. ‚è±Ô∏è Implement integration tests with actual SQLite database
3. ‚è±Ô∏è Set up UI automation tests

## TDD Workflow Details

### Model Testing
We've tested the core data models (Item, User, Message) for:
- Property change notifications
- Default value initialization
- Validation logic

### Service Testing
We've created a robust testing approach for database services:
- Mocked services for isolated unit testing
- Test coverage for all CRUD operations
- Error handling scenarios

### ViewModel Testing
Our ViewModel tests ensure:
- Commands correctly execute business logic
- Property changes are properly propagated
- Error handling is robust
- Input validation works as expected

## Code Coverage Goals

| Component    | Current Coverage | Target Coverage |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Models       | 90%              | 95%            |
| Services     | 85%              | 90%            |
| ViewModels   | 80%              | 90%            |
| Views        | 0%               | 70%            |

## Next Implementation Priorities

1. **Complete Authentication System**
   - Implement secure password hashing in UserViewModel
   - Add token storage using SecureStorage
   - Create login/registration views with validation

2. **Finalize Item Management**
   - Implement image upload and storage
   - Complete CRUD operations for items
   - Add category management

3. **Location Services**
   - Implement proper geolocation permission handling
   - Add map integration
   - Complete nearby items search functionality

## TDD Lessons Learned

1. **Mock Services First**: Creating mock services early helps isolate tests and enables parallel development.
2. **Test Edge Cases**: Ensure tests cover error conditions and boundary cases.
3. **Refactor Tests Too**: As we refactor implementation code, we also need to refactor tests for clarity.
4. **Keep Tests Fast**: Optimize tests to run quickly to encourage frequent test runs.
